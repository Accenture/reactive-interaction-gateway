# Distributed deployment

Reactive Interaction Gateway (RIG) uses [Peerage library](https://github.com/mrluc/peerage) to do discovery in distributed mode (production Distillery release).

**Note:** If you don't care about distributed mode and don't want to do discovery, follow just `General configuration` section and ignore rest of the text.

## General configuration

1. Node host - Every node in cluster needs to be discoverable by other nodes. For that Elixir/Erlang uses so called `long name` or `short name`. We are using `long name` which is formed in the following way `app_name@node_host`. `app_name` is in our case set to `rig`, but `node_host` is taken from environment variable `NODE_HOST`. This can be either IP or container alias or whatever that is routable in network by other nodes.

1. Node cookie - Nodes in Erlang cluster use cookies as a form of authorization between them. Only nodes with the same cookie can communicate together. It can be either some plain string or ideally some generated hash, set it to `NODE_COOKIE` environment variable.

## DNS discovery

RIG currently supports distributed deployment via DNS discovery. To make it work, you need to set two things:

1. Discovery type - Currently RIG supports only DNS discovery. To use DNS, set `DISCOVERY_TYPE` to `dns`.

1. DNS name (address) - Address where peerage will do discovery for Node host addresses. Value is taken from environment variable `DNS_NAME`.

DNS discovery is executed every 5 seconds.
