# Reactive Interaction Gateway Channels Example

Example shows how Phoenix channels work inside Reactive Interaction Gateway (RIG), how it interacts with Kafka and at the same time uses API Proxy.

Components involved:
- Kafka & Zookeeper
- RIG => Main component responsible for proxy and live communication
- External service => has REST API endpoint that can produce message to Kafka
- UI => Connects to RIG via WS/SSE, does REST API call to External service through RIG, consumes events from subscribed Phoenix channel

## Quick start

If you want to just quickly start the application and see what's going on run `sh ./run-compose.sh`. Script just builds docker image for each component, runs compose file and registers needed REST API. Once scrip is done you can visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Manual start

This approach is a bit slower, but allows you to play with a code.

**Terminal 1:** Start Zookeeper and Kafka

```sh
docker-compose -f kafka.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**Terminal 1:** Start RIG (from root directory)

For RIG we could use default configuration values, but where's fun in that. Let's change them so we can also see how to configure certain things to our needs.

```sh
# Description of environment variables

# PORT => Port at which we want to expose RIG, by default 4000
# PRIVILEGED_ROLES => This is a string array of roles that can see also broadcasts from other people, not just it's own, by default empty array
# JWT_ROLES_FIELD => Key in JWT claims/payload under which PRIVILEGED_ROLES are set for each user, by default roles
# JWT_USER_FIELD => Key in JWT claims/payload that is used to construct topic name for Phoenix channel, by default user
# KAFKA_USER_FIELD => Key in Kafka message, by which RIG knows where to broadcast, by default user
# SESSION_ROLE => Type of channels we want make visible using REST API, by default user
# KAFKA_SOURCE_TOPICS => Name of Kafka topic to which consumer will connect, by default rig
# KAFKA_LOG_TOPIC => Name of Kafka topic to which producer will produce messages, by default rig
# JWT_SECRET_KEY => Secret key by which JWTs are signed, by default empty string

PORT=7000 \
PRIVILEGED_ROLES=admin \
JWT_ROLES_FIELD=levels \
JWT_USER_FIELD=username \
JWT_SECRET_KEY=mysecret \
KAFKA_USER_FIELD=username \
SESSION_ROLE=regularuser \
KAFKA_SOURCE_TOPICS=example \
KAFKA_LOG_TOPIC=example \
mix phx.server
```

**NOTE: These env values are by default set as well for Frontend and Service**

**Terminal 2:** Start Service (from service directory)

```
# Go to service folder
npm i
npm start
```

**Terminal 3:** Start Frontend (from frontend directory)

```
# Go to frontend folder
npm i
npm start # Should automatically open browser window with http://localhost:3000
```

Add new API to RIG. REST API calls from Frontend goes through RIG to external services, thus we need to tell RIG that such API exists (or define it in initial JSON file). At the same time by this we are testing proxy part of RIG.

```
curl -X "POST" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{\"id\":\"kafka-service\",\"name\":\"kafka-service\",\"version_data\":{\"default\":{\"endpoints\":[{\"id\":\"kafka-producer-endpoint\",\"path\":\"/produce\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"not_secured\":true}]}},\"proxy\":{\"use_env\":false,\"target_url\":\"localhost\",\"port\":8000}}" \
--silent \
"http://localhost:7000/apis"
```

## Example scenarios to test

Few examples you may try with this simple setup.

### Subscribe to my own channel

1. Open two tabs in browser with `http://localhost:3000`
1. First tab: Select some transport type (doesn't matter which)
1. First tab: Fill in `User Name` with e.g. mike
1. First tab: Leave `Levels` field empty
1. First tab: Fill in `Subscribe to topic` with e.g. mike (this has to be the same as your `User Name`)
1. First tab: Press `Connect` => You should see spinner and message on the right side, that you are connected (as well as logs in RIG terminal)
1. Do the same in second browser tab
1. First tab: Fill in `Event message` with e.g. (again username has to match) `{"username":"mike", "payload":"hello"}` (`username` is the only required field, rest of the message can be whatever)
1. First tab: Press `Send event` => You should see messages on the right side in both browser tabs

### Subscribe to some elses channel without privileged role

Repeat steps 1 to 4.

1. First tab: Fill in `Subscribe to topic` with e.g. josh (this has to be different from the `User Name`)
1. First tab: Press `Connect` => You should see error message on the right side, that you are not authorized to subscribe to this channel. That's because you are not owner of the channel nor has privileged role to do so.

### Subscribe to some elses channel with privileged role

Repeat steps 1 to 3.

1. First tab: Fill in `Levels` with admin
1. First tab: Fill in `Subscribe to topic` with e.g. josh (this has to be different from the `User Name`)
1. First tab: Press `Connect` => This time you should be successfully subscribed to someone elses channel.

Repeat steps 7 to 9.
