## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2018-11-09

### Added

- [Auth] JWT now supports RS256 algorithm in addition to HS256. [#84](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/84)
- [Outbound] Support Kafka SSL and SASL/Plain authentication. [#79](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/79)
- [Inbound] Add new endpoints at `/_rig/v1/` for subscribing to CloudEvents using SSE/WS, for creating subscriptions to specific event types, and for publishing CloudEvents. [#90](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/90)
- [Inbound] Expose setting for proxy response timeout. [#91](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/91)
- [Inbound] Subscriptions inference using JWT on SSE/WS connection and subscription creation. [#90](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/90)
- [Inbound] Allow publishing events to Kafka and Kinesis via reverse-proxy HTTP calls. Optionally, a response can be waited for (using a correlation ID).
- [Docs] Simple event subscription examples for SSE and WS.
- [Outbound] Kafka/Kinesis firehose - set topic/stream to consume and invoke HTTP request when event is consumed.

### Changed

- [Inbound] SSE heartbeats are now sent as comments rather than events, and events without data carry an empty data line to improve cross-browser compatibility. [#64](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/64)
- [Docs] General documentation and outdated info.

### Removed

- [Inbound] Previous SSE/WS communication via Phoenix channels.
- Events that don't follow the CloudEvents spec are no longer supported (easy migration: put your event in a CloudEvent's `data` field).

### Fixed

- [Inbound] Flaky tests in `router_test.exs` -- switching from `Bypass` to `Fakeserver`. [#74](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/74)
- [Docs] Channels example. [#64]https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/issues/64
