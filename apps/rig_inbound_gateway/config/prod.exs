# ## Using releases
#
# If you are doing OTP releases, you need to instruct Phoenix
# to start the server for all endpoints:
#
config :phoenix, :serve_endpoints, true
#
# Alternatively, you can configure exactly which server to
# start per endpoint:
#
#     config :rig, RigInboundGateway.Endpoint, server: true
#

# Finally import the config/prod.secret.exs
# which should be versioned separately.
# import_config "prod.secret.exs"
