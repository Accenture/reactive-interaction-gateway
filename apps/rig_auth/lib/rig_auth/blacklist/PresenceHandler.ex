  Handles Phoenix Presence events.

  Implemented as a Phoenix.Tracker, this module tracks all events it receives
  from the given Phoenix PubSub server. Only join events that refer to the
  `@blacklist_topic` are considered for inclusion into the blacklist, and
  leave events are ignored (i.e., forwarded only).

  The blacklist server is started from, and linked against, this server.
